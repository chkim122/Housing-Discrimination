This guide will help set up your environment to run the code in the Housing-Discrimination repository

1) Install the following modules/packages: 
	- python 
	- re
	- os
	- sys 
	- datetime
	- numpy 
	- pandas 
	- selenium 
	- geckodriver
	- linecache

2) Create a folder in the "stores" directory named after the city that you would like to test (i.e. houston)

3) Create a folder in the folder that you created in step 2. Name it by your current round in that city (i.e. round_1)

4) Place a csv file of the zip codes that you would like to run in the file you created in step 3. Make sure line 1 of this 
   file only contains "zip_codes" and the zip codes that you would like to test are following this line. 

5) In terminal, run zip_url_finder.py. 
	Req: python zip_url_finder.py <csv file> <round number> <city path> <state>
	Ex:  python zip_url_finder.py ~/Housing Discrimination Project/stores/houston/round_1 1 houston tx

6) In terminal, run rhgeo.py. rhgeo.py scrapes information from each of the lisitng urls that were crawled from the step 5. 
	Req: python rhgeo.py <rental/selling> <start> <end> <docker id> <input file> 
	Ex:  python rhgeo.py rental            0       400   1           houston_tx_round_1

7) After step 6 is complete,
